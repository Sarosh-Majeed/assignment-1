### **1. Screenshot of Gitea Repository (Showing README with Name & Roll Number)**

In this task, I worked on setting up **Gitea** inside **GitHub Codespace**.
Gitea is like a smaller version of GitHub that runs on our own server. It helps us create and manage repositories.

First, I opened the Codespace and started the **Gitea server**. When it was running, I opened the Gitea page in the browser.
Then, I created a **new repository in Gitea** and added a **README.md** file that included my **name and roll number**.

After creating and saving it, I **pushed** the file from Codespace to my Gitea repository to check everything was working.
This confirmed that my **Gitea server and repository were set up correctly**.

üì∏ **Screenshot:**
The screenshot shows my Gitea repository with the README file containing my details.

### **2. GitHub Assignment 1 Repository (with README and Large Files)**

In this task, I learned how to handle and upload **large files (more than 100 MB)** using **Git LFS (Large File Storage)**.
Normally, GitHub does not allow uploading files larger than 100 MB, but Git LFS helps to store them easily.

I installed **Git LFS** and tracked three large files in my repository. Git LFS keeps only small ‚Äúpointers‚Äù in the main repo while storing actual large files separately.
After tracking, committing, and pushing them, the upload worked successfully.

This showed that I correctly used **Git LFS** to handle large files.

### **3. Screenshot or Output of `git remote -v` (Showing Both Remotes)**

In this task, I had to **connect my Gitea repository with GitHub** to make both repositories synchronized.
I used the same project from Task 1 and created a new repository on GitHub named **Assignment 1**.

Then, I added both **Gitea** and **GitHub** as remote repositories.
When I pushed my README.md file, it was visible on both platforms successfully.

This proved that both remotes were connected properly and working fine.

### **4. GitHub Pages Link to My CV / Portfolio Website**

In this task, I created my **personal CV / portfolio website** using **GitHub Pages**.
First, I made a new repository named `<username>.github.io` (for example, **sarosh-majeed.github.io**).
This type of repository is used by GitHub to host free websites.

Then, I created the following files:

* **index.html** ‚Üí for writing the website content and structure.
* **style.css** ‚Üí for designing and styling the webpage.

I added my personal details, education, and skills in the HTML file and used CSS to make it look nice and professional.
After committing and pushing all files, GitHub automatically hosted my site live.
