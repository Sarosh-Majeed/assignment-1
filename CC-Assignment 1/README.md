### **1. Screenshot of Gitea Repository (Showing README with Name & Roll Number)**

In this task, I worked on setting up **Gitea** inside **GitHub Codespace**.
Gitea is like a smaller version of GitHub that runs on our own server. It helps us create and manage repositories.

First, I opened the Codespace and started the Gitea server. When it was running, I opened the Gitea page in the browser.
Then I created a **new repository in Gitea** and added a **README.md** file in it.
This README file contained my **name and roll number**.

After that, I uploaded (pushed) this README file from Codespace to my Gitea repository.
This showed that my **Gitea server and repository were working correctly**.

üì∏ **Screenshot:**
The screenshot shows my Gitea repository with the README file that contains my details.

### **2. GitHub Assignment 1 Repository (with README and Large Files)**

In this task, I learned how to upload **large files (more than 100 MB)** using **Git LFS (Large File Storage)**.
Normally, GitHub doesn‚Äôt allow files larger than 100 MB, but Git LFS helps us store them easily.

I installed **Git LFS** in my repository and added three large files to it (each was more than 100 MB).
Git LFS saves only a pointer in the main repo while storing the actual big file separately.
After tracking and committing the files, I uploaded them to my **GitHub Assignment 1** repository.

This made sure all my large files were properly stored and didn‚Äôt cause upload errors.

### **3. Screenshot or Output of `git remote -v` (Showing Both Remotes)**

In this task, I had to **connect my Gitea repository with GitHub** and mirror the same README file there.
I used the same project that I created in Task 1, and then made a new repository on GitHub named **Assignment 1**.

After that, I connected both repositories together so that my work on Gitea could also be seen on GitHub.
When I uploaded (pushed) the README.md file, it appeared on GitHub successfully.
This proved that both my **Gitea and GitHub repositories were connected properly**.

üì∏ **Screenshot of Git Remote Output:**
The output shows both **‚Äúgitea‚Äù** and **‚Äúgithub‚Äù** are connected as remotes.

### **4. GitHub Pages Link to My CV / Portfolio Website**

In this task, I made my **personal CV / portfolio website** using **GitHub Pages**.
First, I created a new repository named `<myusername>.github.io`
(for example: **sarosh-majeed.github.io**).

This type of repository is used by GitHub to host websites for free.

Then I created the following files:

* **index.html** ‚Üí for the structure and content of my website
* **style.css** ‚Üí for the design, layout, and colors

I wrote my personal information, education, and skills inside the HTML file, and styled it with CSS to make it look attractive.
After uploading all files, GitHub automatically published the website live.
